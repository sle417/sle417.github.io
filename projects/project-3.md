When it comes to building a computer, things may seem convoluted and confusing at first, but when you begin to learn about the essential parts of a computer, which consists of the CPU (Central Processing Unit), GPU (Graphics Processing Unit), Motherboard, RAM (Random Access Memory) , PSU (Power Supply Unit), Storage like SSDs and HDDs and the coolers for it, you develop a better understanding of their functions to make a working PC. Before building my first PC and upgrading it, I knew nothing about computer parts and the market for them. Like many people who upgraded their computers during this pandemic, I was interested in improving my workstation at home to enhance my productivity and also to game.

Through numerous information forums, YouTube videos, and websites I started putting together my very first PC in a matter of a few hours. At first, things seemed very intimidating, because the motherboard manual was super long, there were cables and screws everywhere, and I didn't also want to damage a part that could cost me hundreds. Through diligence and careful precedings, I tried my best to do everything in the order that I learned and then before I knew it, my PC was ready to be set up.

PC Building can be a very scary thing to think about especially for beginners who know nothing like I did but with care and time, it like "adult legos" as some people say. For those who are considering upgrading their systems, I would strongly recommend building your own as you would ultimately save more money and have the benefit of knowing how to maintain and fix your system in the future.
