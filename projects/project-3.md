## Overview

UH Class Critics is a web application that is built and inspired based on the likes of [ratemyprofessor](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/) and other review websites for students. It allows students from the UH Manoa system to particpate in writing reviews and evaluations for professors and courses that they have taken. It also serves as a way for other students to learn about particular courses and make judgments based on the feedback of others, reducing uncertainty and establishing clear expectations. 

The application was built using a combination of Javascript, Semantic UI, and React. It utilizies the Meteor framework as its architecture and the MongoDB database as a way to manage the data coming in and out as users use the website and write new data. A link to the deployment can be found [here](https://class-critics.xyz/#/).

## Collaboration

Using GitHub as a primary way to collaborate on our project, myself and 4 others (Ana Araujo, John Suelen, Johnny Ho, Zi Jun Huang) worked on this project for approximately three weeks. For the duration of this project, my contributions were first creating a discord server for easy communication and establishing a project name. Then, I was responsible for drafting mockup pages, designing the overall theme of the website, constructing the landing page and assisted in efforts of other subsequent page implementations.
