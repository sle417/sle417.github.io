## Overview

The Bank Record Database is a program that I built in the UH Unix terminal while taking ICS 212: Program Structure. This program serves as a simulation of a bank interface to mimick the functionality of bank account management as if someone were maintaining a database of accounts and bank clients on a virtual computer system. Some functions I implemented for this bank record program are the adding, deleting, printing, finding of bank records as well as a function to log out or exit when the user is done using it. Once the program is executed within the uinx terminal, users will ten be displayed a list of menu options that I have listed above. From there, the user can do whatever they want with the existing bank records which are stored in a .txt file. They can also create new records and store them accordingly as if there were new clients for a bank.

## Takeaway

Although this project may seem basic and straightforward, it was actually a project that I struggled with for a while. As a novice programmer who only basic Java, transitioning to a high level programming language like C, learning new syntax as well as new concepts like pointers was difficult for me, especially when it came to the implementation of certain functions. Ultimately, I believe this project strengthened my programming skills as a CS student and I found this experience to be valuable.

## Source Code

Unfortunately, The Source Code for this project has been lost, but I would imagine it is easy to recreate, even in different languages. A small portion of the code can be seen in the only picture I have of my bank database program, but it provides insight into how I addressed certain problems during the development of this program, such as dealing with restricting input.
