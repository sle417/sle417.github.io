Farm-tastic is a simple point based game where you are able to control a tractor and your objective is to horde all the farm animals back to where they belong. I developed this game using an integrated java class called "EZ Java" which basically simplifies Java methods so that students can manipulate and interact with JFrames in a way that is easy to learn and work with. 

The basis of this game allowed me to learn about how coordinates work visually, making boundaries with objects, and creating conditionals for certain events. Below is a video demonstrating how it works.
