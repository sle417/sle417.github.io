## First Encounters with Javascript
When I first heard of the programming language Javascript, I had just assumed that it was an extension of Java, which to me was a very strict and particular language that required specific syntax, formats, etc. Upon first learning Javascript, I was actually surprised by how different it was to Java which I learned back in the fall of 2019. Almost immediately, I could see that it was more versatile and "free" than Java because of a few reasons. One of the first things I noticed was how variables were declared. The simple use of var, let, and const and its ability to be manipulated to other data types was something that stuck out to me because it seemed very convenient and flexible. After going through the lessons on FreeCodeCamp and working through the examples, it also became apparent to me that Javascript seemed less redundant and cleaner than Java in terms of writing source code. There were straightforward ways to simplify code such as reducing a function method to just one line of code, manipulating arrays and even accessing nested elements leading me to grow interest in the language.

## Challenges with learning a new programming language
I believe Javascript is a good programming language because of its unique features such as the triple equals sign for example and more that I will eventually learn. From my introductory experience with Javascript, I think it helps make source code a lot more readable and concise, which all code should be. Personally, I believe that learning Javascript thus far has been a mixture of struggling to internalize certain things and loving it for its simplicity. Considering that I have had programming experience in the past (ICS 111, ICS 211), learning basic concepts of Javascript has been easy because they have been present in other languages I have learned. What I find challenging when it comes to learning Javascript and new programming languages in general, is the ability to apply the new syntax and concepts in my assignments and projects. Sometimes, a function or line of code could be written in a much better way, but sometimes I often find myself conforming to the traditional and possibly longer, more redundant code and this is something I want to improve and work on as I expand my knowledge and experience in programming.

## The prospect of coding effectively
I think athletic software engineering is extremely useful in today's world. With the pace that technology is advancing, there will always be new problems and new technologies that we will have to adapt to as upcoming computer science students entering the industry and I think the ability to work through and solve coding problems is something that will be handy not just for job interviews but writing good efficient code as well. I find that the practice WODs in my ICS 314 class are quite helpful because they present me with a time constrainted challenge to come up with a solution. Computer Science is a reasonably competitive industry and being able to solve problems effectively in a timely manner is a very valuable skill that many companies will prioritize and potentially seek. I think the format and style of learning for ICS 314 is fine the way it is because it encourages learning through challenges that each individual student has to tackle. Furthermore, the collaborative aspect of ICS 314 allows for us CS students to communicate our thoughts, ideas and ultimately grow our understanding and knowledge of new things we learn. I hope that as I learn more Javascript, I will be able to learn coding strategies and work through problems better.
